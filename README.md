## Why dezugin

My name is Hugo Souza, I used to roam the internets with the deSouza monicker, which got shortened to dez, and the ugin was added after I rekindled my interest in languages and started learning russian. dezugin = Hugo Souza. :)

Chances are that if someone online is using that nick, its me. I'm on telegram and twitter with that handle, you can reach me if you please there or on my email, deSouza@protonmail.com
